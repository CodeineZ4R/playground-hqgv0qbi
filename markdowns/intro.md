# Welcome!
Hi, welcome to the Java Guild Meeting of May 2018. The theme of this meeting is **exploring Java**. Some of the features we're going to touch might be very familiar to you while others might be completely foreign concepts. The goal is to let you use more of the language after this event.

## Tech.io
Originally, we planned to use this platform, **tech.io** to let you make these exercises online without any setup. Unfortunately the embedded code editor has let us down a bit. While extensive and providing some IntelliSense, it doesn't resolve imports and has some annoying bugs.

Because of that, the best course of action is to clone this project using your favourite IDE and open the _java-project_ locally. You click the GitHub button at the top right to get to the source code. It's a Maven project (yeah yeah, tech.io doesn't have a Gradle template yet, get of your high horse) so just import the pom and you should be good to go.

After making the exercise you can copy past your code back to tech.io or run the test from that exercise locally, whichever you prefer.
